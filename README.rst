Development setup
=================

Setting up a development environment is as simple as four easy steps.

1. Clone repo (recursively; it contains submodules)
2. Install dependencies
3. Build reST files from JSON files
4. Build HTML files from reST files

All of these steps are explained in detail below.

First, pull down this repo's code::

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/phls/pyvideo.git

Then, install the dependencies for building this site. It is recommended to
install all the requirements inside virtualenv_, use virtualenvwrapper_ to
manage virtualenvs. **Building pyvideo.org requires Python 3.5**

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
.. _virtualenvwrapper: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

First of all, create a virtual environment to install all the dependencies
into either using virtualenvwrapper::

  $ mkvirtualenv -p python3 pyvideo

\... or using pyvenv::

  $ pyvenv .env && source .env/bin/activate

From the root of the repo, run the following command::

  $ pip install -r requirements/dev.in

Finally, you'll be able to generate the HTML site. From the root of the repo,
run the following command::

  $ make html

To view the site, run the following command::

  $ make serve

This will start development server on port 8000. Goto browser and open
http://localhost:8000 to view your local version of pyvideo.org!

Debugging
=========

If you're trying to debug unexpected build results, you can pass one of two
variables to the make process to influence to logging level::

  # Show Pelican warnings
  $ make VERBOSE=1 html

  # Show even more output
  $ make DEBUG=1 html


Accessibility tests
===================

There are automated tests to ensure that none of the pages have significant
accessibility problems; to run them:

1. Download `chromedriver <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>`_
   and add it to your PATH environment variable (copy to ``/usr/local/bin``, etc.)
2. Run ``make test``
